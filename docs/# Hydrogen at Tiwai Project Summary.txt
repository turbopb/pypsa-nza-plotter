# Hydrogen at Tiwai Project Summary 

## Research Question: Can hydrogen production replace the Tiwai Point aluminum 
smelter as an industrial anchor load in Southland, and what value does flexible 
electrolyzer operation provide to the electricity system? 

## Context - Tiwai aluminum smelter consumes ~572 MW baseload 
(~13% of NZ electricity) - Contract uncertain, potential closure creates 
planning challenge - Southland has strong wind resources but limited local demand 
without Tiwai - Transmission capacity from Southland to North Island could be 
freed up or remain valuable - Hydrogen for industry/export is under-analyzed in  NZ context
 
## Analytical Approach 
**Capacity expansion planning** using PyPSA-NZA model: 
- Use existing detailed NZ network topology (Southland region + HVDC to North Island) 
- Make key generation capacity extendable (Southland wind/solar, potentially national VRE) 
- Add electrolyzer as extendable "Link" component at Tiwai/Manapouri bus 
- Optimize what gets built and how system operates under different scenarios 

## Scenario Framework 
**Scenario A: Baseline** 
- Tiwai aluminum operating, current system
 
**Scenario B: Tiwai closure** 
- No replacement load, see how system adapts
 
**Scenario C: Baseload hydrogen** 
- Electrolyzer replaces Tiwai with equivalent baseload H2 production
 
**Scenario D: Flexible hydrogen** 
- Electrolyzer sized and operated to absorb excess VRE, no fixed H2 demand ## Key Modeling Decisions 
- **Time horizon**: Single planning year (e.g., 2035) 
or multi-year transition - **Temporal resolution**: Representative periods (computational efficiency) 
or full 8760 hours - **VRE penetration**: Fix national renewable target or let optimization 
decide - **Extendable components**: Southland wind/solar, electrolyzer capacity, possibly national VRE
 
## Expected Outputs - Optimal electrolyzer size and capacity factor under each scenario 
- New generation capacity (especially Southland wind) - System costs comparison (total 
annualized capex + opex) - Transmission flows and utilization (HVDC, local constraints) 
- VRE curtailment with/without hydrogen - Hydrogen production cost ($/kg H2) 
- Locational marginal prices at key buses ## Policy Value 
- Economic competitiveness of H2 vs. aluminum 
- Value of grid flexibility from responsive industrial load 
- Transmission infrastructure planning (build more vs. utilize freed capacity) 
- Regional economic development implications (Southland) 
- Path to industrial decarbonization 

## Implementation Strategy 
1. Add electrolyzer Link components to existing PyPSA-NZA model 
2. Configure extendable generators for capacity expansion 
3. Define scenario parameters and constraints 
4. Run capacity expansion optimization for each scenario 
5. Extract and compare results across scenarios 
6. Focus on policy-relevant metrics and trade-offs

## Alternative flexible loads **Yes, you can substitute other load absorbers**, and
 this could broaden your analysis: 
 ### Electric Vehicle Charging 
 **Pros**: 
 - Growing policy interest in NZ transport electrification 
 - Natural demand flexibility (charge when cheap) 
 - Distributed across regions (not just Southland) 
 **Cons**: - Much smaller scale than Tiwai (~572 MW vs. maybe 50-100 MW EV charging 
 peak nationally by 2035) 
 - More complex modeling (need charging patterns, V2G vs. unidirectional) 
 - Less spatial concentration (harder to see regional transmission impacts) 
 **Modeling**: Add as flexible Load with time-of-use constraints ### Data Centers 
 **Pros**: 
 - Large, concentrated loads (100-500 MW possible) 
 - Some computational workloads are time-shiftable 
 - Real commercial interest in NZ (cheap renewable power) 
 **Cons**: 
 - Less operational flexibility than electrolyzers (many workloads are latency-sensitive) 
 - Different value proposition (selling compute vs. producing molecules/fuel) 
 - Less established flexible operation precedent 
 **Modeling**: 
 Add as partially flexible Load or curtailable load with payment for interruption 
 
 ### Comparison for your case: **Hydrogen** is the best fit because: 
 1. **Scale matches**: Can actually replace Tiwai's 572 MW 
 2. **True flexibility**: Can ramp 0-100% on sub-hourly timescales 
 3. **Energy storage**: Produced H2 can be stored (unlike data/charging which must meet demand) 
 4. **Policy relevance**: Industrial decarbonization pathway, not just load shifting
  
 **However**, you could do a **comparative analysis**: 
 - Size each technology to absorb same amount of excess VRE energy 
 - Compare flexibility value, capacity factors, system costs 
 - Shows policymakers the relative merits of different flexible load strategies 
 If you want to keep scope manageable, **stick with hydrogen**. If you want to 
 expand impact, add EV charging as a sensitivity case (simpler than data centers).
